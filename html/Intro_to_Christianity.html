    <h1>Introduction to Christianity</h1>
    <p>Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. It is the world's largest religion, with over two billion followers worldwide. Christians believe in the Holy Trinity, which consists of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>The Bible is the sacred scripture of Christianity, divided into the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament contains texts that are also part of the Jewish faith, while the New Testament focuses on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
